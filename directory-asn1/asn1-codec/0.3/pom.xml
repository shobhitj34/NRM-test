  <name>Stateful chunking codec API for ASN.1 runtime</name>
  <version>0.3</version>
  <description>API for stackable stateful encoders and decoders.  Such codec interfaces
    allow for the efficient processing of data as it is made available while
    maintaining small actively processing footprints.  Of course these aspects
    depend on the implementation as well however this API standardizes the
    minimum set of interfaces associated with codec's that are stateful.
    Until this API is added to the commons-codec project several interfaces
    and classes here are duplicated to minimize the number of dependencies:
    namely a dependency on commons-codec will be avoided.</description>
